 # Union Find (Disjoint Set Union)

a data structure that keeps track of a partition of a set into disjoint subsets (no sets overlap)

### Two Core Operations: 
- **Find** - determine which set an element belongs to. determines if 2 elements are in the same set.
- **Union** - merge two sets together. Useful when there is a relationship between 2 elements.

useful for when we need to find whether 2 elements belong to the same group.
